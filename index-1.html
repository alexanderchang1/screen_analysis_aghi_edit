<ol>
<li>
<p>Convert raw sequencing files into library counts using bowtie alignment</p>
<p>The script used for this step is <strong>fastqgz_to_counts.py</strong>, and requires a reference fasta file of the library used in the
experiment. Indices for several published libraries are included here, and more can be generated upon request.
<p>
2. Generate sgRNA phenotype scores, gene-level scores, and gene-level p-values</p>
<p>This step relies on the script <strong>process_experiments.py</strong>. This script requires you to first fill out a configuration file which allows you to:
<em> Assign the read counts generated for each sequencing file to the appropriate sample condition
</em> Specify which conditions you want to compare in order to generate phenotypes
<em> Set several data quality filtering and normalization parameters
</em> Specify how to score genes</p>
<p>This script also generates a set of standard graphs using <strong>screen_analysis.py</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Optional] Generate graphs interactively using <strong>screen_analysis.py</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python v3 (tested in 3.7; legacy scripts for v2.7 are available in the python2 folder)</li>
<li>Biopython</li>
<li>Scipy/Numpy/Pandas/Matplotlib</li>
<li>iPython or iPython Notebook recommended for interactive graph plotting</li>
</ul>
<p>(ScreenProcessing no longer uses Bowtie to align sequencing reads; if you want to use or fork from this functionality use an earlier version of the program)</p>
